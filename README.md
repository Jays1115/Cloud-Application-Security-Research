# Cloud Application Security Research & Presentation

<h2>Description</h2>
Scenario: 
With the application (Sasha) now up and running as expected, it's time to consider the potential risks Verizon might encounter during the application monitoring phase. The app is reaching its next stable phase and now the team is shifting focus to evaluating its security measures. This is a crucial step in ensuring the cloud application is properly reinforced against malicious attacks before going live. Given that the app involves authentication and the handling of user credentials, it is essential to thoroughly assess its vulnerabilities and proactively implement security measures.
<br/><br/>
For this task, I conducted online research to identify effective security strategies for protecting the application during production deployment and beyond, with a focus on network, application, and data security.

<h3>Quick Research</h3>
<h4>Search Term: "<b>firewall rules cloud computing</b>"</h4>

Best practice ([Resource](https://cloud.google.com/firewall/docs/firewalls)) <br/>
- Block all traffic by default and only allow the specific traffic you need. This includes limiting the rule to just the protocols and ports you need.<br/>

What is a Cloud Firewal? ([Resource](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cloud/what-is-a-cloud-firewall/))
- A cloud firewall is a security product that, like a traditional firewall, filters out potentially malicious network traffic. Unlike traditional firewalls, cloud firewalls are hosted in the cloud.
<br/>

<h4>Search Term: "<b>traffic encryption cloud computing</b>"<h4/> 

How does Cloud Encryption Work? ([Resource](https://www.zscaler.com/resources/security-terms-glossary/what-is-cloud-encryption)) <br/>
- TLS is the standard encryption protocol that used with HTTPS web traffic in order to encrypt data in transit <br/>
- Can encrypt data using Symmetric or Asymmetric Encryption.<br/>

<h4>Search Term: "<b>standard cloud encryption for data at rest</b>"<h4/> 
  
How does Cloud Encryption Work? ([Resource](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/efs-encrypted-file-systems/encryption-of-data-at-rest.html)) <br/>
- The industry standard encryption for data at rest is AES-256

<h3>Meeting Presentation</h3>
I used the above research to inform my slide for the team presentation on cloud application security. Most of the presntation was already completed by other team member, below is the slide I was responsible for: <br/><br/>
